My name is David Stephens, Stephens with a P-H. I'm a British technologist living in London, who has a love of bikes, computers, beer,
taking photos, drums, and adventure games by Sierra (Space Quest IV is a particular favourite). I also spend a fair amount of time smashing things 
together in Ruby - that combined with RubyMine makes hacking away on code a nice passtime. 

I've worked in the financial services industry most of my career, with companies such as Goldman Sachs and more recently Credit Suisse. You can 
find out more about me professionally at [LinkedIn][linkedin].

You can also find me on a variety of other places across the t'interwebs:

* [Twitter][twitter] - Random ramblings
* [Google+][gplus] - It's better than Facebook
* [Instagram][instagram] - Short stories via photo snapshots
* [GitHub][github] - Not a great deal here, although I was responsible for the pilot of GitHub Enterprise at my current place of work
* [StackOverflow][stackoverflow] - Dev Q&A, mostly Ruby/Rails or DevOps related stuff.
* [Untappd][untappd] - Beer I've drunk
* [Last.fm][lastfm] - Rock 'n roll
